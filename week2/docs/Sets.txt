A set is a boolean representation of a data:
    For example for enum:{1,2,3}, a set of that enum has
    the possibility of being: 
        -[1,1,1] >> complete array
        -[1,1,0] >> {1,2}
        -[1,0,1] >> {1,3}
        -[0,1,1] >> {2,3}
        -[0,0,0] >> {}

Makes it easier to express the constraints.

The model uses the highest level model

Choosing set representation:
    -var set of OBJ
        -->Good if the solver natively support sets
        -->Good when OBJ is not too big
    -array[OBJ] of var bool / 0..1
        -->Good when OBJ is not too big
    -array[1..u] of var OBJ
        -->Only for fixed cardinality u
        -->good when u is small
    -array[1..u] of bar OBJx
        -->Need to represent the "null" object
