Usually data files define values for parameters:

Can be enumerated types too.
    enum: COLOR; (in color.mzn)
    COLOR = {R,W,B,G,P};(color.dzn)

Datafiles only contain assignment items:
    usually parameters but is also possible for decision variables

Any parameters not assigned in model must be assigned in file

A model is a formal description of a class of our optimization problems.


To make a model into a instance:
    Just add DATA
